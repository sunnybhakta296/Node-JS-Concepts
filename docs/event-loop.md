## How the Call Stack Receives and Processes Requests

**Description:**  
When you run a Node.js program, the JavaScript engine (V8) parses your code and starts executing it line by line. Each function call, method, or operation is pushed onto the call stack. The call stack is a LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) data structure that keeps track of what function is currently running and what should run next.

**How it works:**
1. The main script is pushed onto the call stack and starts executing.
2. When a function is called, it is pushed onto the stack. When it returns, it is popped off.
3. If the code encounters an asynchronous operation (like setTimeout, fs.readFile, or a network request), the call to the async API is pushed onto the stack, but the actual async work is offloaded to Node.js APIs (libuv). The callback is registered to be executed later.
4. The call stack continues executing the next lines of code without waiting for the async operation to finish.
5. When the stack is empty, the event loop checks the callback queues. If there are callbacks ready (from completed async operations), they are pushed onto the call stack and executed.

**Example:**
```javascript
console.log('A');
setTimeout(() => console.log('B'), 0);
console.log('C');
// Output: A, C, B
```

**Explanation:**
- 'A' is logged (call stack)
- setTimeout is called; its callback is offloaded and scheduled
- 'C' is logged (call stack)
- When the stack is empty, the event loop pushes the setTimeout callback onto the stack, and 'B' is logged

**Interview Tip:**
- The call stack only ever contains synchronous code. Async callbacks are handled by the event loop and pushed onto the stack when ready.

**Tip:**
- Use this table to quickly map a Node.js interview question or real-world scenario to the relevant event loop concept(s).

---

**How it works:**
1. The call stack executes all synchronous code.
2. After the stack is empty, all microtasks are executed (in order).
3. The event loop then processes the next macrotask (e.g., timer, I/O callback).
4. This cycle repeats.

**Example:**
```javascript
console.log('script start');
setTimeout(() => console.log('setTimeout'), 0); // macrotask
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log('promise')); // microtask
process.nextTick(() => console.log('nextTick')); // microtask (Node.js only)
console.log('script end');
// Output: script start, script end, nextTick, promise, setTimeout
```


**Interview Tip:**
- Microtasks always run before the next macrotask. In Node.js, `process.nextTick` has even higher priority than Promises.

## How Node.js Runs Behind the Scenes

**Definition:**  
Node.js runs JavaScript code outside the browser using the V8 engine. It combines the V8 engine, libuv (for async I/O), and a set of C++ bindings to provide a non-blocking, event-driven architecture. When you run a Node.js program, your code is executed by the V8 engine, and asynchronous operations are managed by libuv and the event loop.

**How it works (step-by-step):**
1. **V8 Engine:** Parses and executes JavaScript code.
2. **Call Stack:** Handles function calls and execution order.
3. **Node APIs & C++ Bindings:** Provide access to file system, networking, etc.
4. **libuv:** Handles async operations (I/O, timers, thread pool).
5. **Event Loop:** Schedules and executes callbacks for async operations.
6. **Callback/Event Queues:** Store callbacks to be executed in the right phase.

**Example:**
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
console.log('Start');
fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
	if (err) throw err;
	console.log('File content:', data);
});
console.log('End');
// Output: Start, End, File content: ...
```


**Interview Tip:**
- Be ready to explain the flow: V8 → Call Stack → Node APIs → libuv → Event Loop → Callback Queue.

## Call Stack

**Definition:**  
The call stack is a data structure used by the JavaScript engine to keep track of function calls and their execution order. When a function is called, it is pushed onto the stack; when it returns, it is popped off. The call stack works together with the event loop to manage synchronous and asynchronous code execution in Node.js.

**How it works:**  
Synchronous code is executed directly on the call stack. When asynchronous operations (like timers or I/O) are encountered, their callbacks are offloaded and scheduled to run later, allowing the call stack to remain unblocked.

**Example:**
```javascript
function first() {
	second();
}
function second() {
	third();
}
function third() {
	console.log('In third');
}
first();
// Call stack: first -> second -> third
```

**Interview Tip:**
- Understanding the call stack is essential for debugging, stack traces, and knowing how async code is handled in Node.js.

# Node.js Event Loop, Libuv, and Queues

## Event Loop
**Definition:**  
The event loop is the core mechanism in Node.js that enables non-blocking, asynchronous I/O. It continuously checks for and processes events, callbacks, and I/O operations, allowing Node.js to handle many connections efficiently with a single thread.

**Example:**
```javascript
console.log('Start');
setTimeout(() => console.log('Timeout'), 0);
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log('Promise'));
process.nextTick(() => console.log('NextTick'));
console.log('End');
// Output: Start, End, NextTick, Promise, Timeout
```

---

## Libuv
**Definition:**  
Libuv is a multi-platform C library that provides Node.js with an event-driven, asynchronous I/O model. It implements the event loop, thread pool, and handles low-level operations like file system access, networking, and timers.

**Key Features:**
- Cross-platform support (Windows, Unix, macOS)
- Event loop and thread pool
- Asynchronous TCP/UDP sockets and pipes
- File system and DNS operations

**Example (conceptual):**
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
	if (err) throw err;
	console.log(data); // Runs asynchronously via libuv's thread pool
});
```

---

## Event Loop Phases
**Definition:**  
The event loop executes in a series of phases, each handling a specific type of callback. The main phases are:

1. **Timers:** Executes callbacks scheduled by `setTimeout` and `setInterval`.
2. **Pending Callbacks:** Executes I/O callbacks deferred to the next loop iteration.
3. **Idle, Prepare:** Internal use only.
4. **Poll:** Retrieves new I/O events; executes I/O-related callbacks.
5. **Check:** Executes callbacks scheduled by `setImmediate`.
6. **Close Callbacks:** Executes close event callbacks (e.g., `socket.on('close')`).

**Example:**
```javascript
setTimeout(() => console.log('timeout'), 0);
setImmediate(() => console.log('immediate'));
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log('promise'));
process.nextTick(() => console.log('nextTick'));
```

---

## Event Phase Priority
**Definition:**  
The order in which callbacks are executed is determined by their phase priority. Microtasks (process.nextTick, Promises) are always executed before the event loop continues to the next phase.

**Priority Order:**
1. `process.nextTick` queue (highest)
2. Microtasks queue (Promises)
3. Event loop phases (Timers, Poll, Check, etc.)

**Example:**
```javascript
console.log('start');
setTimeout(() => console.log('timeout'), 0);
setImmediate(() => console.log('immediate'));
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log('promise'));
process.nextTick(() => console.log('nextTick'));
console.log('end');
// Output: start, end, nextTick, promise, timeout, immediate (timeout/immediate order may vary)
```

---

## Microtasks Queue
**Definition:**  
The microtasks queue holds callbacks from Promises and `process.nextTick`. These are executed after the currently executing script and before the event loop continues to the next phase.

**Example:**
```javascript
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log('Promise microtask'));
process.nextTick(() => console.log('nextTick microtask'));
console.log('Main script');
// Output: Main script, nextTick microtask, Promise microtask
```

---

## Event Queue (Callback Queue)
**Definition:**  
The event queue (or callback queue) holds callbacks for events like timers, I/O, and setImmediate. These are processed in the appropriate event loop phase after all microtasks are completed.

**Example:**
```javascript
setTimeout(() => console.log('Timer callback'), 0);
setImmediate(() => console.log('Immediate callback'));
console.log('Main script');
// Output: Main script, Timer callback, Immediate callback (order may vary)
```

## Microtask and Macrotask Queues

**Definition:**  
Node.js (and JavaScript engines) use two main types of queues to manage asynchronous operations:

- **Microtask Queue:**  
	Holds tasks that should run immediately after the currently executing script, before the event loop continues. Includes `process.nextTick` and Promise callbacks.

- **Macrotask (Task/Event) Queue:**  
	Holds tasks scheduled by timers (`setTimeout`, `setInterval`), I/O, and `setImmediate`. These are processed in the appropriate event loop phase.
---

## libuv API Example
**Definition:**  
libuv provides C APIs for asynchronous I/O, but in Node.js, you use its features via JavaScript APIs (fs, net, timers, etc.).

**Example (TCP server using net module, powered by libuv):**
```javascript
const net = require('net');
const server = net.createServer((socket) => {
	socket.write('Hello from TCP server!\n');
	socket.on('data', (data) => {
		console.log('Received:', data.toString());
	});
});
server.listen(9000, () => console.log('TCP server listening on port 9000'));
```

## How Node.js Identifies Synchronous vs Asynchronous Calls

Node.js determines whether a function is synchronous or asynchronous based on the API being used:

- **Synchronous calls** are executed directly by the JavaScript engine (V8). These functions run to completion and block the call stack until finished. Examples: `console.log()`, `JSON.parse()`, or `fs.readFileSync()`.

- **Asynchronous calls** are recognized by their use of Node.js APIs that interact with the system (file system, network, timers, etc.) and accept a callback or return a Promise. When Node.js encounters such a call (e.g., `fs.readFile()`, `setTimeout()`), it:
	1. Offloads the operation to **libuv** (for I/O, timers, etc.).
	2. Frees up the call stack to continue executing other code.
	3. When the async operation completes, libuv pushes the callback onto the appropriate queue (event/microtask/macrotask).
	4. The event loop picks up the callback and executes it when the stack is empty.

**Summary Table:**

| Type         | Example                | Where it runs         | How Node.js handles it         |
|--------------|------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------|
| Synchronous  | `fs.readFileSync()`    | Call Stack (V8)       | Runs immediately, blocks stack|
| Asynchronous | `fs.readFile()`        | libuv (Thread Pool)   | Offloaded, callback queued    |
| Asynchronous | `setTimeout()`         | libuv (Timers)        | Offloaded, callback queued    |
| Asynchronous | `Promise.resolve()`    | Microtask Queue (V8)  | Scheduled after script        |
